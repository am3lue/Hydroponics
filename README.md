# Hydroponics System

This repository contains the code and documentation for a **Hydroponics System** project designed to automate water and nutrient delivery to plants using sensors and microcontrollers.

## Project Overview

The **Hydroponics System** is an automated solution for growing plants in a water-based, nutrient-rich environment without the need for soil. The system uses sensors to monitor environmental conditions such as water levels, pH, and nutrient concentration. It adjusts the flow of water and nutrients based on the data collected to optimize plant growth.

## Features

- **Automated Water Delivery**: Ensures that plants get the correct amount of water at the right time.
- **Nutrient Control**: Regulates nutrient levels in the water to maintain optimal growth conditions.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Monitors water pH, temperature, and nutrient levels using sensors.
- **Real-time Adjustments**: Uses sensor feedback to make real-time adjustments to water flow and nutrient delivery.

## Components

### Hardware:
- **Arduino MEGA 2560**: Microcontroller used for controlling the sensors and actuators.
- **Water Pumps**: Automated pumps used for delivering water to the plants.
- **Relays and Valves**: Controls the flow of water and nutrients.

### Software:
- **Arduino C++ Code**: Controls the sensors and actuators.
- **Julia Web Application** (Optional): For updating system parameters over Wi-Fi or local network.
  
## Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Setup

- Connect the **Arduino MEGA 2560** to the required sensors and actuators.
- Use relays to control the water pumps and valves.
- Set up the sensors (pH, EC, and water level) to gather environmental data.

### 2. Software Setup

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/am3lue/hydroponics
  ```
  
- Install dependencies for the Arduino:
  - Use the Arduino IDE to install the necessary libraries for sensor and actuator control (e.g., `EEPROM`, `Wire`, `LiquidCrystal`, etc.).

### 3. Upload Code

- Upload the **Arduino code** to your Arduino MEGA 2560 using the Arduino IDE.
- Ensure that the sensors and actuators are correctly connected to the board before powering it on.

### 4. Testing

- Power up the system and monitor the Serial Monitor output for sensor readings and actuator activity.
- If using the web app, access the web interface via your browser to update parameters (e.g., water flow, nutrient levels).

## Usage

1. Start the system by powering on the Arduino.
2. The sensors will monitor environmental data and automatically adjust water flow and nutrient delivery.
3. Use the Serial Monitor or the web app to check system status and adjust parameters.
